# ðŸ”Ž Awesome Quicksearch Collection

Welcome to the **Awesome Quicksearch Collection**â€”a curated list of search engine shortcuts that allow you to search websites directly from your browser, launcher, or custom scripts.

## What Are Quicksearches?

Quicksearches (also known as **custom search engines** or **keyword searches**) are special URLs that let you perform searches on specific websites with a simple command. By replacing a placeholder (`%s`) with your search term, you can quickly find what you need without navigating to the site first.

For example:

- **YouTube** â€“ `https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%s`
- **GitHub** â€“ `https://github.com/search?q=%s&ref=opensearch`
- **Flickr** â€“ `https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=%s`

## How to Use These Quicksearches

1. **Browser Setup:**

    - In **Chrome/Edge**: Go to `chrome://settings/searchEngines`, add a new search engine, and assign a keyword.
    - In **Firefox**: Right-click on a search bar > "Add a keyword for this search."
2. **Launcher Integration:**

    - Add them to **Alfred, Raycast, Wox, or ueli** for faster access.
3. **Custom Scripts:**

    - Use them in shell scripts or automation tools to perform instant lookups.
